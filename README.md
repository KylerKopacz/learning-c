# learning-c
All of the code that I have written while reading "The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition", by Brain Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

Low level programming is very interesting to me. I wanted to learn C to get a better idea of how code is excecuted at a low level, to have more control over memory, and to write efficient programs "close to the metal".

I will try to include all the code that I write. All of the programs are suggested excercises from the book. I am trying to complete all of the exercises, and throw in some projects at the end of chapters where I can take all that I learned and implement it in a final chapter project. But if there are exercises that I find to be boring, I might not include them.

This project is currently: INACTIVE
